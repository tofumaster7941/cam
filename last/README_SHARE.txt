To play the game:

1. Double-click the 'start_game.command' file.
   - It will start a local server and verify your camera permissions.
   - It should automatically open your default web browser to the game.

2. If you see a security warning (common on Mac):
   - Right-click (or Control-click) 'start_game.command'.
   - Select 'Open' from the menu.
   - Click 'Open' in the dialog box.

3. Troubleshooting:
   - If the browser doesn't open, manually go to http://localhost:8000
   - You need Python 3 installed on your computer (most Macs have it).
